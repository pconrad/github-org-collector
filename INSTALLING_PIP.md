To install pip on your system, the following links might be helpful.


* On Windows, try adding `C:\Python27\` and `C:\Python27\Scripts` to your system `path` environment variable (do a web search for directions on how to do that.)
* For all OSes: Try this: [Installing via git-pip.py script](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* [Installing via setuptools and easy_install on Windows](http://blog.troygrosfield.com/2010/12/18/installing-easy_install-and-pip-for-python/)

Or just do a web search on `install pip blah` where `blah` is replaced by your OS (`windows`, `mac`, or your flavor of linux).
